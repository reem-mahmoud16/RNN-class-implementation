I traveled through China, I traveled through Russia, and I traveled everywhere you can ever imagine. But my story starts in Jakarta. I didnâ€™t like traveling but I was challenged by my friend, Benny, to discover new things in this whole world, to do things that no one has ever done, and he said he would give me a surprise if I did it, so I took the challenge. I was confused where to start, but I kept on thinking. I texted my friend where to start and he told me just to follow the Earth. I kept on wondering what that meant, until I saw the map of the Earth.
